\bigskip{}

This Agreement is made by and between the NumFOCUS Foundation (``NumFOCUS'')
and \contributors{} (the ``\signatories{}'') on behalf of the project known as
\project{} (the ``Project'') (each, a ``Party''; together, ``the Parties'').
NumFOCUS is a Texas nonprofit public benefit corporation located in Austin,
Texas, which has received ecognition of exemption from federal income tax under
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and classification as a
public charity under IRC Sections 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(vi).

\textsc{Whereas:}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.,ref=\S \Alph*]

\item NumFOCUS' organizational mission and charitable goal is to promote the
  use of accessible and reproducible computing in science and technology
  through educational programs, support of reproducible scientific research,
  and the development of open source software, collaborative research tools and
  documentation.

\item The purpose of the Project is to produce, distribute, document, and
  improve software and/or documentation that can be freely copied, modified and
  redistributed, and for which modified versions can also be redistributed
  (``Open Source Software''), and to facilitate and organize its production,
  improvement and ease of use.

\item NumFOCUS desires to act as the fiscal sponsor of the Project beginning on
  the Effective Date (as defined below) to assist the Project in accomplishing
  its purpose, which NumFOCUS has determined will further NumFOCUS' charitable
  goals. The \signatories{} desire to manage the Project under the sponsorship
  of NumFOCUS.

\item NumFOCUS' Board of Directors has approved the establishment of a fund to
  receive donations of cash and other property earmarked for support of the
  Project and to make disbursements in furtherance of the Project's mission
  (the ``Project Fund''). Currently, the principal office of the Project is
  located at: \leadershipaddress{}.

\end{enumerate}

\medskip{}

\textsc{Now, therefore, the Parties hereby agree as follows:}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.,ref=\S~\arabic*]
\item \textbf{Term of Agreement}. As of the Effective Date, the Project
joins NumFOCUS, which relationship will continue unless and until
terminated as set forth in \ref{Termination}. 
\item \textbf{Project Management and Activities}.


\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.,ref=\theenumi(\alph*)]

\item \textbf{The \leadershipbody{} Will Manage the
  Project}. \label{ProjectManagement} Authority to manage the technical,
  artistic and philanthropic direction of the Project and the program
  activities of the Project is delegated to the \leadershipbody{} as defined in
  \ref{Representation}, subject at all times to the direction and control of
  NumFOCUS' Board of Directors \fix{(This sentence is probably too strong and
    needs changing for our sponsorship model - fperez)}. NumFOCUS will only intervene in the program
  activities to the extent the Project is not in compliance with
  \ref{OpenSourceSoftware} or \ref{CharitablePurpose} of this Agreement.
  
\item \textbf{The Project Will Be Open Source
  Software}. \label{OpenSourceSoftware} NumFOCUS and the \leadershipbody{}
  agree that any and all software and/or documentation distributed by the
  Project will be distributed solely as Open Source Software.  NumFOCUS retains
  the sole right to determine whether Project's software and/or documentation
  constitutes Open Source Software (as defined herein).
  
\item \textbf{Ultimate Responsibility of Project}. Subject to
  \ref{ProjectManagement} of this Agreement, all community programs, public
  information work, fundraising events, processing and acknowledgment of cash
  and non-cash revenue items, accounts payable and receivable, negotiation of
  leases and contracts, disbursement of Project funds (including grants), and
  other activities planned by the Project shall be the ultimate responsibility
  of NumFOCUS and shall be conducted in the name of NumFOCUS, beginning on the
  Effective Date.
  
\item \textbf{Project Not An Agent Of NumFOCUS}. The \signatories{} hereby
  acknowledge that the Project and the \leadershipbody{} do not and shall not
  act as an agent for NumFOCUS unless specifically authorized in writing by
  NumFOCUS to do so.

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Fees}. The \signatories{} agree to donate ten percent (10\%) of
  the Project's gross revenue (including, but not necessarily limited to, all
  income and donations) to NumFOCUS for its general operations. \fix{We need to
    decide what our final overhead level will actually be. 5\%, 8\%?. 10 seems
    a bit high since we're explicitly going to do a lot less than SWC.}


Notwithstanding the above, the \signatories{} agree that should NumFOCUS
be required to pay any taxes (including but not limited to sales taxes
and unrelated business taxable income) as the result of any activity
of the Project and/or activities undertaken by NumFOCUS on the
Project's behalf, such taxes shall be deducted from the Project Fund.


NumFOCUS will monitor any unrelated business taxable income and
may require the Project to cease activities generating such income
if the overall amounts exceed amounts permissible or prudent for NumFOCUS,
given NumFOCUS' tax exempt status.

\item \textbf{Project Fund/Variance Power}. Beginning on the Effective Date,
  NumFOCUS shall place all gifts, grants, contributions and other revenues
  received by NumFOCUS and identified with the Project into a Project Fund to
  be used for the sole benefit of the Project's mission as that mission may be
  defined by the \leadershipbody{} from time to time with the approval of
  NumFOCUS. NumFOCUS retains the unilateral right to spend such funds so as to
  accomplish the purposes of the Project as nearly as possible within NumFOCUS'
  sole judgment \fix{I think this sentence is too strong for our model -
    fperez}.  NumFOCUS agrees to make a good faith effort to consider any
  expressed donor intent in making determinations on the expenditure of that
  donor's gift; however, the Parties acknowledge that expressions of donor
  intent are not legally binding on NumFOCUS. The Parties agree that all money,
  and the fair market value of all property, deposited in the Project Fund be
  reported as the income of NumFOCUS, for both tax purposes and for purposes of
  NumFOCUS' financial statements. It is the intent of the Parties that this
  Agreement be interpreted to provide NumFOCUS with variance powers necessary
  to enable NumFOCUS to treat the Project Fund as NumFOCUS' asset in accordance
  with Financial Accounting Statement No. 136 issued by the Financial
  Accounting Standards Board, while this Agreement is in effect.
  
\item \textbf{Project Fund Management / Performance of Charitable
  Purposes}. \label{CharitablePurpose} All of the assets received by NumFOCUS
  under the terms of this Agreement shall be devoted to the purposes of the
  Project, within the tax-exempt purposes of NumFOCUS. The \signatories{} agree
  not to use its funds or operate in any way which would jeopardize the
  tax-exempt status of NumFOCUS. No item of revenue shall be earmarked for use
  in any attempt to influence legislation within the meaning of IRC Section
  501(c)(3) and no agreement, oral or written, to that effect shall be made
  between NumFOCUS and any revenue source. NumFOCUS shall not use any portion
  of the assets to participate or intervene in any political campaign on behalf
  or in opposition to any candidate for public office, to induce or encourage
  violations of law or public policy, to cause any private inurement or
  improper private benefit to occur, nor to take any other action inconsistent
  with IRC Section 501(c)(3).

\item \textbf{Representation of the Project in
  NumFOCUS}. \label{Representation}The \signatories{}, each a signatory hereto,
  hereby establish and comprise the initial members of the \leadershipbody{} to
  represent the Project in its official communication with NumFOCUS.  The
  \signatories{} hereby acknowledge that the \leadershipbody{} will be subject
  to all terms of this Agreement.  On the Effective Date, the \signatories{}
  hereby transfer all rights, obligations and privileges of this Agreement over
  to the \leadershipbody{}.

\fix{We probably should say explicitly that we require a single point of
  contact from the leadership body. Right now it's listed in one of the
  examples but not mandated in the main template. I think our model should be
  that we mostly interact with the leadership body via a single representative
  (though we can discuss things with the whole body if needed) - fperez.}

\item \textbf{Outstanding Liabilities}. The \signatories{} represent that any
  liabilities that may be outstanding in connection with the Project have been
  disclosed to NumFOCUS.

\item \textbf{Termination}. \label{Termination} The \leadershipbody{} or
  NumFOCUS may terminate this Agreement at any time subject to the following
  understandings \fix{We might tone this down, since our involvement is less
    hands-on than SWC's}:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.,ref=\theenumi(\arabic*)]

\item \textbf{Notice and Successor Search}. Either NumFOCUS or the
  \leadershipbody{} may terminate this Agreement on sixty (60) days' written
  notice to the other Party, so long as a Successor can be found that meets the
  following requirements (the ``Successor has Qualified''):


\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.,ref=\theenumi(\alph{enumii})(\roman*)]
  
\item the Successor is another nonprofit corporation which is tax-exempt under
  IRC Section 501(c)(3),
  
\item the Successor is not classified as a private foundation under Section
  509(a),
  
\item the Successor is willing and able to sponsor the Project, and,
  
\item the Successor has (a) communicated its willingness to sponsor the Project
  in writing to NumFOCUS and (b) sent a copy of its 501(c)(3) determination
  letter to NumFOCUS, and,
  
\item the Successor is approved in writing by both Parties by the end of the
  60-day period, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
  
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Additional Search Periods}. If the Parties cannot agree on a
  Successor to sponsor the Project, the \leadershipbody{} shall have an
  additional 60 days to find a Successor willing and able to sponsor the
  Project. Any subsequent search periods of any length shall only be granted at
  NumFOCUS' written permission.

\item \textbf{Transfer to a Successor}. If a Successor has Qualified, the
  balance of assets in the Project Fund, together with any other assets held or
  liabilities incurred by NumFOCUS in connection with the Project, shall be
  transferred to the Successor within thirty (30) days of the approval of the
  Successor in writing by both Parties or any extension thereof, subject to the
  approval of any third parties that may be required.

\item \textbf{Termination Without a Successor}. If no Successor is found,
  NumFOCUS may dispose of Project assets and liabilities in any manner
  consistent with applicable tax and charitable trust laws.

\item \textbf{\signatories{}' Right to Terminate.}  The \signatories{} hereby
  acknowledge that they will relinquish any rights to terminate separate from
  the \leadershipbody{} as of the Effective Date.

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Miscellaneous}. Each provision of this Agreement shall be
  separately enforceable, and the invalidity of one provision shall not affect
  the validity or enforceability of any other provision.  This Agreement shall
  be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
  Texas. This Agreement constitutes the only agreement, and supersedes all
  prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
  with respect to the subject matter hereof.

\item \textbf{Amendments. }This Agreement may not be amended or modified,
  except in writing and signed by both NumFOCUS and the entirety of
  \leadershipbody{}.

\item \textbf{Counterparts / Facsimile}. This Agreement may be executed in two
  or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
  which, when together, shall constitute but one and the same instrument, and
  shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
  Party hereto and delivered to the other Party.  In lieu of the original, a
  facsimile transmission or copy of the original shall be as effective and
  enforceable as the original.

\end{enumerate}
