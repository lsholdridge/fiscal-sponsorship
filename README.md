# Fiscal sponsorship agreement for NumFOCUS and open source projects

Materials for the Fiscal Sponsorship of open source projects under the NumFOCUS umbrella.


## Creating a new agreement

For each project to be sponsored, a new directory should be created with
*copies* of the Makefile and TeX files in this directory. Then, each project
will fill out these three TeX files: `fsa-definitions.tex`, `leadership-body.tex`
and `signatures.tex`.  If the project agrees to the terms of the agreement,
nothing else should be modififed. In particular, the main container document
should *not* be edited (other than renaming it to refer to each project) unless
the project specifically wishes to amend/modify the terms of the agreement.

Keeping this in a separate file will make it easier to track which projects
have requested a modified FSA instead of accepting the standard template.
